This... is a breakout clone. I made it to see if I could (no tutorials this time).
It took about an hour and a half for the main thing (the breakout-clone.py).
I then spent much longer in inkscape making some pretty bricks, and improved the
game flow so it had text on the screen and things. And a weekend making music
since this was just an excuse for that.

TODO:

* Improve physics. Really, it should reflect the angle at which the ball
  hits the  paddle (got that), and the angle should be able to change. (not yet)

  I may just leave this project as-is and do it on the next, since this was
  just a disposable 'what can I do and how quickly can I do it?' thing.

  (Ball movements are currently not
  that finegrained, since the x is either -ballspeed or + ballspeed, and ditto
  for y. so that means that it's currently always bouncing off at a 90 degree
  angle. so to begin with, ballspeedx needs to be decoupled from ballspeedy.
  then, they need to be calculated relative to their previous value, which
  should map to the angle.)

* Put this up somewhere in public. The awkward part is the music. The files
  should be smaller and probably uploaded somewhere separate to the repo.

* Maybe make pretty backgrounds. This is tough as a) I don't know how and
  b) They need to be visually distinct from the bricks. Other games use
  photography for this. I'm rubbish at photography and would rather not
  use my holiday snaps.
  
ABOUT:

  I'll license this with some appropriate open source licence. I'm not
  sure about the music, though.
