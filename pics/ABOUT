I made these in inkscape. I just cheated and made them the same size
as the rects in the game. I don't know how to use inkscape, so I
just made the document the size of the brick I wanted, and zoomed in.
Then I drew a rectangle the size of the document in whatever solid
colour. Next, I drew a white rectangle over it, and changed the colour
to a gradient radiating out from the center. Finally, I gave the
white-gradienty rectangle a horizontal gradient border with the
stroke tool, which made the rectangle look slightly bevelled. Repeat
once for each rectangle colour. (I warned you I don't know how to use
inkscape). I used the same trick for the paddle. For the ball, I just
made a few rectangles on top of each other, decreasing in size, and
made them lighter or darker to give the illusion of volume (I tried
using a gradient in 'ball-2', but it looked worse, so I used my manual
ball).

You can see my early brick attempts with just a horizontal gradient.
Use them for a retro feel...
